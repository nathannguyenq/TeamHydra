You’re not from around here are you? You better tread carefully, the locals ain’t too kind to strangers.~Some of our kind have lost their minds since the plague broke out. It’ll be wise to keep your distance.~I’ve lived in this kingdom all my life. It may not look like much but this is home for me…..Jess, if you could only see it now.~That stinking king has been on his high horse looking down on the rest of us forever….he’ll get what’s coming to him.
....I always knew there was something off about this whole situation. The people started hunting our kind down ever the start of this whole mess and all this time it was for nothing. ….Just so he can stay sitting pretty eh? He deserves everything that’s coming to him.~Hehe….so the emperor isn’t wearing clothes after all. I think I may have something available for us to take advantage of this situation. If you can find a way to get that blasted king to eat it he won’t be an issue anymore.~Finally, it won’t be long now Jess….

I can’t offer you much but my wares, hopefully it helps.~I would try to leave but there’s guards all over this place. It was safer for me to just stay here.~I may be stuck here but I still need to make a living.
