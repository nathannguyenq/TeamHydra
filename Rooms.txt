RICIN POUCH USED in CL_3 No one is here yet so you decide to sit and wait.... Some time has passed and in comes the king and his court to take their seats high atop the world. The chef walks in with their carefully prepared dinner and you watch as one by one they all take their first bites. Their faces light up in bliss from the taste initially, however, slowly they come to the realization that something isn’t right but at this point it’s already too late. They start dropping like flies. One after the other, you watch as the old world collapses before you. The last among them is the king, who, with his last fiber of life catches a glimpse of you in the corner before he closes his eyes for good. Still clutching to what little sense of control he thought he had left. The deed is done. To the WEST there’s a large double door to exit through.
WHEN RICIN POUCH NOT USED The room is longer than the rest of the rooms in this castle but it isn’t any less decorated. Taking up most of the space is a table as long as the room with blood red cloth draped upon it. There are about fifty chairs, including two large ones at the far end.
